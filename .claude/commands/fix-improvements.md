description: Implement findings from IMPROVEMENTS.md — plan, delegate to specialist agents, review, and update the tracker
---

finding_numbers = $ARGUMENTS

If finding_numbers is not provided, read IMPROVEMENTS.md and show the ## Active Findings table, then ask the user which finding numbers to implement (comma-separated).

## Phase 1: Parse and validate findings

1. Read `IMPROVEMENTS.md` at the project root.
2. Parse the finding numbers from the arguments (comma-separated, e.g. `27,28,34`).
3. For each number, extract from the **Active Findings** table:
   - Priority, Finding description, Effort, Impact, Agent(s), Status
4. For each number, extract the detailed description from **Active Findings (Detailed)**.
5. If any number is not found or already completed, warn the user and skip it.
6. Present a summary table of the findings to implement.

## Phase 2: Create implementation plan

1. Use **EnterPlanMode** to create a structured plan.
2. For each finding, outline:
   - What needs to change (files, patterns)
   - The recommended approach (from the detailed description)
   - Which specialist agent(s) to delegate to (from the Agent(s) column)
3. Group findings that can be implemented independently vs those with dependencies.
4. Present the plan and use **AskUserQuestion** to confirm:
   > "Implementation plan ready. Proceed?"
   - Options: "Proceed", "Adjust plan", "Cancel"
   - If "Adjust plan", ask what to change and regenerate.
   - If "Cancel", stop.

## Phase 3: Implement findings

For each finding (or group of independent findings in parallel):

1. Read all relevant source files mentioned in the finding details.
2. Delegate implementation to the appropriate specialist agent(s) listed in the finding's Agent(s) column using the **Agent** tool with the matching `subagent_type`. Common mappings:
   - `postgres-pro` -> subagent_type: "postgres-pro"
   - `database-optimizer` -> subagent_type: "database-optimizer"
   - `performance-engineer` -> subagent_type: "performance-engineer"
   - `architect-reviewer` -> subagent_type: "architect-reviewer"
   - `security-auditor` -> subagent_type: "security-auditor"
   - `nestjs-expert` -> subagent_type: "nestjs-expert"
   - `typescript-pro` -> subagent_type: "typescript-pro"
   - `api-designer` -> subagent_type: "api-designer"
   - `documentation-engineer` -> subagent_type: "documentation-engineer"
   - `refactoring-specialist` -> subagent_type: "refactoring-specialist"
   - `dependency-manager` -> subagent_type: "dependency-manager"
     When a finding lists multiple agents, use the first one as primary. For simple or cross-cutting changes, implement directly without delegation.
3. When delegating to an agent, provide a detailed prompt that includes:
   - The full finding description and fix instructions from IMPROVEMENTS.md
   - The exact file paths and line numbers
   - The project's architecture rules from CLAUDE.md (controllers -> services -> repositories pattern, etc.)
   - Instruction to make the minimal change needed
4. After each agent completes, verify the changes compile: run `pnpm check-types`.
5. If the finding requires a database migration, run `pnpm db:generate` and review the generated SQL.
6. Track progress using **TaskCreate** and **TaskUpdate**.

## Phase 4: Quality checks

1. Run the full check suite:
   ```
   pnpm check-types
   pnpm lint:fix
   pnpm format
   ```
2. Fix any issues that arise.

## Phase 5: Code review

1. Spawn a **code-reviewer** subagent using the **Agent** tool with `subagent_type: "code-reviewer"`.
2. Provide it with:
   - The list of findings implemented and their numbers
   - All changed files (from `git diff --stat`)
   - Instructions to review for correctness, regressions, type safety, and migration safety
3. Present the review results to the user.
4. If the reviewer finds issues, fix them and re-run the review.

## Phase 6: Update IMPROVEMENTS.md

1. Use **AskUserQuestion** to ask:
   > "All findings implemented and reviewed. Update IMPROVEMENTS.md to mark these as completed?"
   - Options: "Yes, update", "No, skip"
2. If "Yes, update":
   - Remove each implemented finding's row from the **## Active Findings** table
   - Remove each implemented finding's detailed entry from **## Active Findings (Detailed)**
   - Add each finding to the **## Completed Fixes (History)** table with status "Done"
3. Run `pnpm format` to ensure the file is clean.

## Phase 7: Wrap up

Present a summary:

```
## Implementation Complete

**Findings implemented:** #<n1>, #<n2>, ...
**Files changed:** <count>
**Migration generated:** Yes/No

Run `/create-pr <ticket_number>` to create a pull request.
```
